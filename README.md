The goal of my project: I wanted to see if there is a correlation between the density of a city and the population change within a year

The license of your data and any source data: Mit License, view-source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_India_by_population

A data type and description for each attribute in your data: 
State - (String) State in which the city is located
Area - (Float) Area in square miles of the city according to government boundaries
2020 Population - (Float) Number of people in the city as of April 1, 2020
2021 Population - (Float) Estimated number of people in the city as of July 1, 2021
Density - (Float) People per square mile as of April 1, 2020
Change - (Float) Percent change in population from April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021

Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection: It is easier to collect data in cities that are more urban, so it is likely that the measured population is more accurate in the most urban cities.
